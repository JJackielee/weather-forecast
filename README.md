# weather-forecast
a weather application that shows you the forecast of a city

## Description

This website will show you the 5 day weather forecast of a city that the user enter into the search bar. It will show the temperature, an icon reflecting the weather, the humidity, wind speed and date. The searched city will then be saved and displayed as a button underneath the search bar. If user want to quick search that city again they can just click on that button. 

What I learned from this project is the usages of jquery and apis. I also learned to use bootstrap for my html. I used fetched to get json data from a weather api. I took user input in the search bar and used it as a query for the api. I then took json data from the response and displayed it into my html with jquery. I also used local storage to be able to store old searches.
